# Problem of the Day Solutions

Welcome to the "Problem of the Day Solutions" repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of solutions to daily programming problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. Each solution is provided in both brute-force and optimized versions, along with a detailed explanation of their time and space complexities.

## Introduction

Programming is all about problem-solving, and daily practice is essential to become a better programmer. This repository is created to help you practice problem-solving skills by providing solutions to a variety of programming challenges from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

For each problem, you will find both brute-force and optimized solutions. Brute-force solutions are typically straightforward but not the most efficient. Optimized solutions aim to find a more efficient approach to solve the problem. Understanding both approaches will help you learn and improve your problem-solving skills.

We also provide details about the time and space complexity of each solution. Understanding the computational cost of your code is crucial when designing efficient algorithms.


## Problem Sources

- **LeetCode**: LeetCode is a popular platform for practising coding problems. You can find their website [here](https://leetcode.com/).

- **GeeksforGeeks**: GeeksforGeeks is an educational and learning platform that provides a wide range of programming challenges and resources. You can find their website [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
  

## Repository Organization

This repository is organized as follows:

  - **codingPlatform**: Within this folder, you'll discover solutions to daily programming challenges from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

  - Inside the `codingPlatform` folder, you'll encounter a folder named `codePOD`.
    
  - Inside the `codePOD` folder, you'll find year folders, neatly arranged by year.
    
  - Within the year folders, month folders are thoughtfully organized by month.
    
  - Inside the month folders, day folders are structured according to the day of the month.
    
  - Within these day folders, you'll discover the solutions to the daily problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, each neatly placed in a file named after the problem's title with the `.cpp` extension.
  
  - Within each problem file, you will find the following solutions:
		- The brute-force solution to the problem.
		- The optimized solution with improved time and space complexity.
		
This structure allows you to easily navigate and find solutions to daily coding challenges from different sources while keeping them organized and accessible.
